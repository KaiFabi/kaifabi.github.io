> Try to be less wrong. You are definitely wrong to some degree. The question is how wrong and can you be less wrong tomorrow. (Elon Musk)

I am a physics graduate who enjoys coding, working with data, and trying out new ideas. 

I mostly use C, C++, and Python to get things done and like to automate stuff with Bash. In this blog I informally share pet projects, ideas and code about topics in machine learning, computational physics and other topics I am interested in.

I am constantly working my way through the field of physics, machine learning and computer science, so I have picked up a few things from these areas.

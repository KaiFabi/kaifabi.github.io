**TL;DR**: Neural networks can be unsure about what they perceive. We introduce a new method called Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation that allows to highlight the network's perceptual uncertainty.

### Abstract

Understanding the perceptual uncertainty of neural networks is key for the deployment of intelligent systems in real world applications. For this reason, we introduce in our new paper a method called Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation (MCRP) for feature relevance uncertainty estimation. A simple but powerful method based on Monte Carlo estimation of the feature relevance distribution to compute feature relevance uncertainty scores that allow a deeper understanding of a neural network's perception and reasoning.
